# Intel how-to code examples with Message Queue Telemetry Transport\* (MQTT\*)

This repository contains the setup information needed to add IoT cloud support to the how-to code examples for Amazon\* Web Services\* (AWS\*), IBM\* Bluemix\* Internet of Things, or Microsoft\* Azure\* IoT Hub.

Start by using the guide that corresponds to your backend environment (e.g., Microsoft\* Azure\*) to set up an MQTT\* server. Then use the guide that corresponds to your programming language (e.g., C++) to add MQTT support to your code.
