# Intel "How To Code" Examples with MQTT

This repository contains the setup information needed to add IoT Cloud support to the "How To Code" examples for Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM Bluemix Internet of Things (IoT), or Microsoft Azure IoT Hub.

Start by using the guide that corresponds to your back-end environment (e.g. Microsoft Azure) to setup the MQTT server.

Then use the guide that corresponds to your programming language (e.g. C++) to add MQTT support to your code.
